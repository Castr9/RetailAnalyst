This project analyzes a Superstore sales dataset (sourced via Google API) to uncover trends, customer behavior, and profitability insights. The goal was to:

📌 Project Overview

    Sharpen data analysis skills (cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis).

    Identify key business insights (best-selling products, regional performance, repeat customers).

    Practice Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

1. Sales Trends

    📈 December had the highest sales (likely due to holiday shopping).

    🔄 Technology products contributed 40% of total revenue.

2. Customer Behavior

    🏆 Top 5 customers accounted for 15% of total sales.

    🔄 Only ~20% of customers were repeat buyers (opportunity for loyalty programs).

3. Profitability

    ⚠️ Some products had negative profit despite high sales (e.g., "Staples").

    🗺️ The West region was the most profitable.    

🚀 How to Run

    Install dependencies:
    bash

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Run the script:
bash

python superstore_analysis.py

Check the plots/ folder for generated visuals.

📈 Next Steps

    Time Series Forecasting (predict future sales with ARIMA).

    RFM Analysis (segment customers by recency/frequency/spending).

    Interactive Dashboard (using Streamlit or Dash).
